# Vehicle Detection and Traffic Signal Time Estimation

This project utilizes a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model for real-time vehicle detection, classifies different vehicle types, counts them, and estimates the time required for the vehicles to pass a traffic signal using linear regression. The data for linear regression is trained using vehicle data from a CSV file.

## Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Detects vehicles from a live video feed or images using a Faster R-CNN pre-trained model.
- **Vehicle Classification**: Detects and classifies different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, bikes, ambulances, etc.).
- **Bounding Box Annotation**: Draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles with labels.
- **Vehicle Counting**: Counts the number of vehicles for each category.
- **Traffic Signal Time Estimation**: Trains a linear regression model based on vehicle data to estimate the time required for vehicles to pass a traffic signal.

## Usage

### 1. Vehicle Detection

The project detects vehicles in an image or video feed using the Faster R-CNN model. Detected vehicles are categorized, counted, and annotated with bounding boxes on the image.

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
### 2. Traffic Signal Time Estimation

Using the `vehicle_data.csv`, the project trains a linear regression model to estimate the time needed for vehicles to pass a traffic signal based on the number of detected vehicles in each category.

### 3. Example CSV Data

The `vehicle_data.csv` contains data with the following columns:
- `car_count`
- `truck_count`
- `bike_count`
- `ambulance_count`
- `other_vehicles_count`
- `time_to_pass`
